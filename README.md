1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? The Gaming Room was a client who 
searchedthrough some software solutions for handling their gaming lounge business. They wanted me to design a comprehensive software application that manages customer registration, 
game inventory management, payment processing, and reservation scheduling. However, the client stayed focused on making a seamless experience for their customers and made sure that 
the software is efficient and user-friendly.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? I particularly trusted my ability in outlining the requirements of a client and translating those into technical 
specifications clearly as the main point. Furthermore, I paid close attention to detail, making sure that every aspect of the software’s functionality has been thoroughly documented.
In addition, I emphasized the significance of user experience in the design while aligning its features with the client’s vision. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? Working through a design document was beneficial in giving a structured 
approach to the software development process. However, the document served as a roadmap, going through the development team and stating that everybody had shared their understanding
of the project requirements. It also facilitated effective collaboration and communication among team members. 

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? If I were to choose one part of my work on these documents 
to revise, I prefer to select a portion related to edge cases and error handling. I would improve that by believing in a more comprehensive exploration of potential errors while 
addressing some common scenarios and understanding how to make the system respond when establishing the robustness of a document.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? Interpreting the needs of a 
user and implementing them was pivotal in shaping my software design. Furthermore, I was able to design features that catered to their customers directly by understanding the client’s 
business model, their target audience, and its expectations. It is important to consider the needs of a user when designing because of its prioritization that establishes intuitive 
final products, making it more likely to be adopted with full success.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? I included a mix of 
understanding the client’s requirements, conducting user research, and working through iterative design techniques as my approach to designing software. Accordingly, I worked 
on making a user-centered design that conducts usability tests and involved some feedback to refine its features of the software. As a part of the future, I would establish my 
design skills further by exploring some emerging UX/UI trends and including end-users in this design process through feedback sessions and usability testing.
